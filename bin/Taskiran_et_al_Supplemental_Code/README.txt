This folder contains the code and data for the "Cell type directed design of synthetic enhancers" paper by Taskiran et al.
It consists of 3 main folders:
    1. General folder contains the notebooks that show how we perform 3 different enhancer design strategies.
    2. Fly folder contains the notebooks that reproduce every fly enhancer analysis and figures in the paper.
    3. Human folder contains the notebooks that reproduce every human enhancer analysis and figures in the paper.
It also includes the custom genome files for fly and human, where the synthetic enhancer are integrated.
The deeplearning models, intermediate and resulting data files, and figure pdfs are provided in the Fly and Human folders.
